To be honest, I am a bit unclear on how the blockchain works. SO here is what I intended to implement:
The chain starts with a dummy block. With a previous hash of "0"
The "previous_hash" is provided by the chain. (Or should be provided by the user
that wants to add a block, and checked against the one in the chain? I guess I'm fuzzy
on the fundamentals of what a blockchain is and how to add blocks to it)
I am assuming the "previous hash" is what we are using to find the previous block,
which I implemented with a dictionary.

All in all, I'm not quite confident on what your expectations are for this exercice,
what the desired outputs are.
